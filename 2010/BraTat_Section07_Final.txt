Copy Constructor: A constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously.

Friend Function: A friend function of a class is defined outside that class' scope but it has the right to access all private and protected members of the class.

Default Parameter: A default argument is a value provided in a function that is automatically assigned by the compiler if the caller of the function doesn't provide a value 
    for the argument with a default value.

Dereference Operator: Denoted by (*), it is used to get the "value pointed by" a pointer.

& as a Parameter: The ampersand when used in a function parameter means to pass by reference. This means the reference of an argument is copied into the formal parameter.
    Inside the function, the reference is used to access the actual argument used in the call.
