INTRODUCTION 


I looked at my notes and I didnâ€™t like them. Iâ€™d spent three days at U.S. Robots 
and might as well have spent them at home with the Encyclopedia Tellurica. 

Susan Calvin had been born in the year 1982, they said, which made her 
seventy-five now. Everyone knew that. Appropriately enough, U.S. Robot and 
Mechanical Men, Inc., was seventy-five also, since it had been in the year of Dr. 
Calvinâ€™s birth that Lawrence Robertson had first taken out incorporation papers 
for what eventually became the strangest industrial giant in manâ€™s history. Well, 
everyone knew that, too. 

At the age of twenty, Susan Calvin had been part of the particular Psycho- 
Math seminar at which Dr. Alfred Panning of U.S. Robots had demonstrated the 
first mobile robot to be equipped with a voice. It was a large, clumsy unbeautiful 
robot, smelling of machine-oil and destined for the projected mines on Mercury. 
â€”But it could speak and make sense. 

Susan said nothing at that seminar; took no part in the hectic discussion 
period that followed. She was a frosty girl, plain and colorless, who protected 
herself against a world she disliked by a mask-like expression and a hypertrophy 
of intellect. But as she watched and listened, she felt the stirrings of a cold 
enthusiasm. 

She obtained her bachelorâ€™s degree at Columbia in 2003 and began graduate 
work in cybernetics. 

All that had been done in the mid-twentieth century on â€œcalculating machinesâ€ 
had been upset by Robertson and his positronic brain-paths. The miles of relays 
and photocells had given way to the spongy globe of plantinumiridium about the 
size of a human brain. 

She learned to calculate the parameters necessary to fix the possible variables 
within the â€œpositronic brainâ€; to construct â€œbrainsâ€ on paper such that the 
responses to given stimuli could be accurately predicted. 



In 2008, she obtained her Ph.D. and joined United States Robots as a 
â€œRobopsychologist,â€ becoming the first great practitioner of a new science. 
Lawrence Robertson was still president of the corporation; Alfred banning had 
become director of research. 

For fifty years, she watched the direction of human progress changeâ€”and leap 
ahead. 

Now she was retiringâ€”as much as she ever could. At least, she was allowing 
someone elseâ€™s name to be inset upon the door of her office. 

That, essentially, was what I had. I had a long list of her published papers, of 
the patents in her name; I had the chronological details of her promotionsâ€”In 
short I had her professional â€œvitaâ€ in full detail. 

But that wasnâ€™t what I wanted. 

I needed more than that for my feature articles for Interplanetary Press. Much 
more. 

I told her so. 

â€œDr. Calvin,â€ I said, as lushly as possible, â€œin the mind of the public you and 
U.S. Robots are identical. Your retirement will end an era and â€”â€ 

â€œYou want the human-interest angle?â€ She didnâ€™t smile at me. I donâ€™t think she 
ever smiles. But her eyes were sharp, though not angry. I felt her glance slide 
through me and out my occiput and knew that I was uncommonly transparent to 
her; that everybody was. 

But I said, â€œThatâ€™s right.â€ 

â€œHuman interest out of robots ? A contradiction. â€ 

â€œNo, doctor. Out of you. â€ 

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve been called a robot myself. Surely, theyâ€™ve told you Iâ€™m not 
human. â€ 



They had, but there was no point in saying so. 


She got up from her chair. She wasnâ€™t tall and she looked frail. I followed her 
to the window and we looked out. 

The offices and factories of U.S. Robots were a small city; spaced and planned. 
It was flattened out like an aerial photograph. 

â€œWhen I first came here,â€ she said, â€œI had a little room in a building right 
about there where the firehouse is now. â€ She pointed. â€œIt was torn down before 
you were born. I shared the room with three others. I had half a desk. We built 
our robots all in one building. Outputâ€”three a week. Now look at us. â€ 

â€œFiftyyears,â€ I hackneyed, â€œis a long time.â€ 

â€œNot when youâ€™re looking back at them,â€ she said. â€œYou wonder how they 
vanished so quickly. â€ 

She went back to her desk and sat down. She didnâ€™t need expression on her 
face to look sad, somehow. 

â€œHow old are you?â€ she wanted to know. 

â€œThirty-two, â€ I said. 

â€œThen you donâ€™t remember a world without robots. There was a time when 
humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend. Now he has creatures to 
help him; stronger creatures than himself, more faithful, more useful, and 
absolutely devoted to him. Mankind is no longer alone. Have you ever thought of 
it that way?â€ 

â€œIâ€™m afraid I havenâ€™t. May I quote you?â€ 

â€œYou may. To you, a robot is a robot. Gears and metal; electricity and 
positrons.â€”Mind and iron! Human-made! If necessary, human-destroyed! But 
you havenâ€™t worked with them, so you donâ€™t know them. Theyâ€™re a cleaner better 
breed than we are. â€ 

I tried to nudge her gently with words, â€œWeâ€™d like to hear some of the things 



you could tell us; get your views on robots. The Interplanetary Press reaches the 
entire Solar System. Potential audience is three billion, Dr. Calvin. They ought to 
know what you could tell them on robots. â€ 

It wasnâ€™t necessary to nudge. She didnâ€™t hear me, but she was moving in the 
right direction. 

â€œThey might have known that from the start. We sold robots for Earth-use then 
â€”before my time it was, even. Of course, that was when robots could not talk. 
Afterward, they became more human and opposition began. The labor unions, of 
course, naturally opposed robot competition for human jobs, and various 
segments of religious opinion had their superstitious objections. It was all quite 
ridiculous and quite useless. And yet there it was. â€ 

I was taking it down verbatim on my pocket-recorder, trying not to show the 
knuckle-motions of my hand. If you practice a bit, you can get to the point where 
you can record accurately without taking the little gadget out of your pocket. 

â€œTake the case of Robbie,â€ she said. â€œI never knew him. He was dismantled 
the year before I joined the companyâ€”hopelessly out-of-date. But I saw the little 
girl in the museum â€”â€ 

She stopped, but I didnâ€™t say anything. I let her eyes mist up and her mind 
travel back. She had lots of time to cover. 

â€œI heard about it later, and when they called us blasphemers and demonÂ¬ 
creators, I always thought of him. Robbie was a non-vocal robot. He couldnâ€™t 
speak. He was made and sold in 1996. Those were the days before extreme 
specialization, so he was sold as a nursemaid â€”â€ 

â€œAs a what?â€ 


â€œAs a nursemaid â€”â€ 



ROBBIE 


â€œNinety-eightâ€”ninety-nineâ€”one hundred.â€ Gloria withdrew her chubby little 
forearm from before her eyes and stood for a moment, wrinkling her nose and 
blinking in the sunlight. Then, trying to watch in all directions at once, she 
withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against which she had been leaning. 

She craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the 
right and then withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark 
recesses. The quiet was profound except for the incessant buzzing of insects and 
the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird, braving the midday sun. 

Gloria pouted, â€œI bet he went inside the house, and Iâ€™ve told him a million 
times that thatâ€™s not fair.â€ 

With tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her 
forehead, she moved determinedly toward the two-story building up past the 
driveway. 

Too late she heard the rustling sound behind her, followed by the distinctive 
and rhythmic clump-clump of Robbieâ€™s metal feet. She whirled about to see her 
triumphing companion emerge from hiding and make for the home-tree at full 
speed. 

Gloria shrieked in dismay. â€œWait, Robbie! That wasnâ€™t fair, Robbie! You 
promised you wouldnâ€™t run until I found you.â€ Her little feet could make no 
headway at all against Robbieâ€™s giant strides. Then, within ten feet of the goal, 
Robbieâ€™s pace slowed suddenly to the merest of crawls, and Gloria, with one 
final burst of wild speed, dashed pantingly past him to touch the welcome bark 
of home-tree first. 

Gleefully, she turned on the faithful Robbie, and with the basest of ingratitude, 
rewarded him for his sacrifice by taunting him cruelly for a lack of running 



ability. 


â€œRobbie canâ€™t run,â€ she shouted at the top of her eight-year-old voice. â€œI can 
beat him any day. I can beat him any day.â€ She chanted the words in a shrill 
rhythm. 

Robbie didnâ€™t answer, of courseâ€”not in words. He pantomimed running 
instead, inching away until Gloria found herself running after him as he dodged 
her narrowly, forcing her to veer in helpless circles, little arms outstretched and 
fanning at the air. 

â€œRobbie,â€ she squealed, â€œstand still!â€â€”And the laughter was forced out of her 
in breathless jerks. 

â€”Until he turned suddenly and caught her up, whirling her round, so that for 
her the world fell away for a moment with a blue emptiness beneath, and green 
trees stretching hungrily downward toward the void. Then she was down in the 
grass again, leaning against Robbieâ€™s leg and still holding a hard, metal finger. 

After a while, her breath returned. She pushed uselessly at her disheveled hair 
in vague imitation of one of her motherâ€™s gestures and twisted to see if her dress 
were torn. 

She slapped her hand against Robbieâ€™s torso, â€œBad boy! Iâ€™ll spank you!â€ 

And Robbie cowered, holding his hands over his face so that she had to add, 
â€œNo, I wonâ€™t, Robbie. I wonâ€™t spank you. But anyway, itâ€™s my turn to hide now 
because youâ€™ve got longer legs and you promised not to run till I found you.â€ 

Robbie nodded his headâ€”a small parallelepiped with rounded edges and 
corners attached to a similar but much larger parallelepiped that served as torso 
by means of a short, flexible stalkâ€”and obediently faced the tree. A thin, metal 
film descended over his glowing eyes and from within his body came a steady, 
resonant ticking. 

â€œDonâ€™t peek nowâ€”and donâ€™t skip any numbers,â€ warned Gloria, and scurried 
for cover. 

With unvarying regularity, seconds were ticked off, and at the hundredth, up 



went the eyelids, and the glowing red of Robbieâ€™s eyes swept the prospect. They 
rested for a moment on a bit of colorful gingham that protruded from behind a 
boulder. He advanced a few steps and convinced himself that it was Gloria who 
squatted behind it. 

Slowly, remaining always between Gloria and home-tree, he advanced on the 
hiding place, and when Gloria was plainly in sight and could no longer even 
theorize to herself that she was not seen, he extended one arm toward her, 
slapping the other against his leg so that it rang again. Gloria emerged sulkily. 

â€œYou peeked!â€ she exclaimed, with gross unfairness. â€œBesides Iâ€™m tired of 
playing hide-and-seek. I want a ride.â€ 

But Robbie was hurt at the unjust accusation, so he seated himself carefully 
and shook his head ponderously from side to side. 

Gloria changed her tone to one of gentle coaxing immediately, â€œCome on, 
Robbie. I didnâ€™t mean it about the peeking. Give me a ride.â€ 

Robbie was not to be won over so easily, though. He gazed stubbornly at the 
sky, and shook his head even more emphatically. 

â€œPlease, Robbie, please give me a ride.â€ She encircled his neck with rosy arms 
and hugged tightly. Then, changing moods in a moment, she moved away. â€œIf 
you donâ€™t, Iâ€™m going to cry,â€ and her face twisted appallingly in preparation. 

Hard-hearted Robbie paid scant attention to this dreadful possibility, and shook 
his head a third time. Gloria found it necessary to play her trump card. 

â€œIf you donâ€™t,â€ she exclaimed warmly, â€œI wonâ€™t tell you any more stories, thatâ€™s 
all. Not oneâ€”â€ 

Robbie gave in immediately and unconditionally before this ultimatum, 
nodding his head vigorously until the metal of his neck hummed. Carefully, he 
raised the little girl and placed her on his broad, flat shoulders. 

Gloriaâ€™s threatened tears vanished immediately and she crowed with delight. 
Robbieâ€™s metal skin, kept at a constant temperature of seventy by the high 
resistance coils within, felt nice and comfortable, while the beautifully loud 



sound her heels made as they bumped rhythmically against his chest was 
enchanting. 

â€œYouâ€™re an air-coaster, Robbie, youâ€™re a big, silver air-coaster. Hold out your 
arms straight. â€”You got to, Robbie, if youâ€™re going to be an air-coaster.â€ 

The logic was irrefutable. Robbieâ€™s arms were wings catching the air currents 
and he was a silver â€™coaster. 

Gloria twisted the robotâ€™s head and leaned to the right. He banked sharply. 
Gloria equipped the â€™coaster with a motor that went â€œBr-r-râ€ and then with 
weapons that went â€œPowieâ€ and â€œSh-sh-shshsh.â€ Pirates were giving chase and 
the shipâ€™s blasters were coming into play. The pirates dropped in a steady rain. 

â€œGot another one. â€”Two more,â€ she cried. 

Then â€œFaster, men,â€ Gloria said pompously, â€œweâ€™re running out of 
ammunition.â€ She aimed over her shoulder with undaunted courage and Robbie 
was a blunt-nosed spaceship zooming through the void at maximum 
acceleration. 

Clear across the field he sped, to the patch of tall grass on the other side, where 
he stopped with a suddenness that evoked a shriek from his flushed rider, and 
then tumbled her onto the soft, green carpet. 

Gloria gasped and panted, and gave voice to intermittent whispered 
exclamations of â€œThat was nice!â€ 

Robbie waited until she had caught her breath and then pulled gently at a lock 
of hair. 

â€œYou want something?â€ said Gloria, eyes wide in an apparently artless 
complexity that fooled her huge â€œnursemaidâ€ not at all. He pulled the curl 
harder. 

â€œOh, I know. You want a story.â€ 


Robbie nodded rapidly. 



â€œWhich one?â€ 


Robbie made a semi-circle in the air with one finger. 

The little girl protested, â€œAgain? Iâ€™ve told you Cinderella a million times. 
Arenâ€™t you tired of it? â€”Itâ€™s for babies.â€ 

Another semi-circle. 

â€œOh, well,â€ Gloria composed herself, ran over the details of the tale in her 
mind (together with her own elaborations, of which she had several) and began: 

â€œAre you ready? Wellâ€”once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl whose 
name was Ella. And she had a terribly cruel step-mother and two very ugly and 
very cruel step-sisters andâ€”â€ 


Gloria was reaching the very climax of the taleâ€”midnight was striking and 
everything was changing back to the shabby originals lickety-split, while Robbie 
listened tensely with burning eyesâ€”when the interruption came. 

â€œGloria!â€ 

It was the high-pitched sound of a woman who has been calling not once, but 
several times; and had the nervous tone of one in whom anxiety was beginning 
to overcome impatience. 

â€œMammaâ€™s calling me,â€ said Gloria, not quite happily. â€œYouâ€™d better carry me 
back to the house, Robbie.â€ 

Robbie obeyed with alacrity for somehow there was that in him which judged 
it best to obey Mrs. Weston, without as much as a scrap of hesitation. Gloriaâ€™s 
father was rarely home in the daytime except on Sundayâ€”today, for instanceâ€” 
and when he was, he proved a genial and understanding person. Gloriaâ€™s mother, 
however, was a source of uneasiness to Robbie and there was always the impulse 
to sneak away from her sight. 



Mrs. Weston caught sight of them the minute they rose above the masking tufts 
of long grass and retired inside the house to wait. 


â€œIâ€™ve shouted myself hoarse, Gloria,â€ she said, severely. â€œWhere were you?â€ 

â€œI was with Robbie,â€ quavered Gloria. â€œI was telling him Cinderella, and I 
forgot it was dinner-time.â€ 

â€œWell, itâ€™s a pity Robbie forgot, too.â€ Then, as if that reminded her of the 
robotâ€™s presence, she whirled upon him. â€œYou may go, Robbie. She doesnâ€™t need 
you now.â€ Then, brutally, â€œAnd donâ€™t come back till I call you.â€ 

Robbie turned to go, but hesitated as Gloria cried out in his defense, â€œWait, 
Mamma, you got to let him stay. I didnâ€™t finish Cinderella for him. I said I would 
tell him Cinderella and Iâ€™m not finished.â€ 

â€œGloria!â€ 

â€œHonest and truly, Mamma, heâ€™ll stay so quiet, you wonâ€™t even know heâ€™s here. 
He can sit on the chair in the corner, and he wonâ€™t say a word,â€”I mean he wonâ€™t 
do anything. Will you, Robbie?â€ 

Robbie, appealed to, nodded his massive head up and down once. 

â€œGloria, if you donâ€™t stop this at once, you shanâ€™t see Robbie for a whole 
week.â€ 

The girlâ€™s eyes fell, â€œAll right! But Cinderella is his favorite story and I didnâ€™t 
finish it. â€”And he likes it so much.â€ 

The robot left with a disconsolate step and Gloria choked back a sob. 


George Weston was comfortable. It was a habit of his to be comfortable on 
Sunday afternoons. A good, hearty dinner below the hatches; a nice, soft, 
dilapidated couch on which to sprawl; a copy of the Times; slippered feet and 
shirtless chest;â€”how could anyone help but be comfortable? 



He wasnâ€™t pleased, therefore, when his wife walked in. After ten years of 
married life, he still was so unutterably foolish as to love her, and there was no 
question that he was always glad to see herâ€”still Sunday afternoons just after 
dinner were sacred to him and his idea of solid comfort was to be left in utter 
solitude for two or three hours. Consequently, he fixed his eye firmly upon the 
latest reports of the Lefebre-Yoshida expedition to Mars (this one was to take off 
from Lunar Base and might actually succeed) and pretended she wasnâ€™t there. 

Mrs. Weston waited patiently for two minutes, then impatiently for two more, 
and finally broke the silence. 

â€œGeorge!â€ 

â€œHmpph?â€ 

â€œGeorge, I say! Will you put down that paper and look at me?â€ 

The paper rustled to the floor and Weston turned a weary face toward his wife, 
â€œWhat is it, dear?â€ 

â€œYou know what it is, George. Itâ€™s Gloria and that terrible machine.â€ 

â€œWhat terrible machine?â€ 

â€œNow donâ€™t pretend you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about. Itâ€™s that robot 
Gloria calls Robbie. He doesnâ€™t leave her for a moment.â€ 

â€œWell, why should he? Heâ€™s not supposed to. And he certainly isnâ€™t a terrible 
machine. Heâ€™s the best darn robot money can buy and Iâ€™m damned sure he set 
me back half a yearâ€™s income. Heâ€™s worth it, thoughâ€”darn sight cleverer than 
half my office staff.â€ 

He made a move to pick up the paper again, but his wife was quicker and 
snatched it away. 

â€œYou listen to me, George. I wonâ€™t have my daughter entrusted to a machineâ€” 
and I donâ€™t care how clever it is. It has no soul, and no one knows what it may be 
thinking. A child just isnâ€™t made to be guarded by a thing of metal.â€ 



Weston frowned, â€œWhen did you decide this? Heâ€™s been with Gloria two years 
now and I havenâ€™t seen you worry till now.â€ 

â€œIt was different at first. It was a novelty; it took a load off me, andâ€”and it 
was a fashionable thing to do. But now I donâ€™t know. The neighborsâ€”â€ 

â€œWell, what have the neighbors to do with it. Now, look. A robot is infinitely 
more to be trusted than a human nursemaid. Robbie was constructed for only one 
purpose reallyâ€”to be the companion of a little child. His entire â€˜mentalityâ€™ has 
been created for the purpose. He just canâ€™t help being faithful and loving and 
kind. Heâ€™s a machine â€”made so. Thatâ€™s more than you can say for humans.â€ 

â€œBut something might go wrong. Someâ€”someâ€”â€ Mrs. Weston was a bit hazy 
about the insides of a robot, â€œsome little jigger will come loose and the awful 
thing will go berserk andâ€”andâ€”â€ She couldnâ€™t bring herself to complete the 
quite obvious thought. 

â€œNonsense,â€ Weston denied, with an involuntary nervous shiver. â€œThatâ€™s 
completely ridiculous. We had a long discussion at the time we bought Robbie 
about the First Law of Robotics. You know that it is impossible for a robot to 
harm a human being; that long before enough can go wrong to alter that First 
Law, a robot would be completely inoperable. Itâ€™s a mathematical impossibility. 
Besides I have an engineer from U.S. Robots here twice a year to give the poor 
gadget a complete overhaul. Why, thereâ€™s no more chance of anything at all 
going wrong with Robbie than there is of you or I suddenly going looneyâ€” 
considerably less, in fact. Besides, how are you going to take him away from 
Gloria?â€ 

He made another futile stab at the paper and his wife tossed it angrily into the 
next room. 

â€œThatâ€™s just it, George! She wonâ€™t play with anyone else. There are dozens of 
little boys and girls that she should make friends with, but she wonâ€™t. She wonâ€™t 
go near them unless I make her. Thatâ€™s no way for a little girl to grow up. You 
want her to be normal, donâ€™t you? You want her to be able to take her part in 
society.â€ 


â€œYouâ€™re jumping at shadows, Grace. Pretend Robbieâ€™s a dog. Iâ€™ve seen 



hundreds of children who would rather have their dog than their father.â€ 


â€œA dog is different, George. We must get rid of that horrible thing. You can sell 
it back to the company. Iâ€™ve asked, and you can.â€ 

â€œYouâ€™ve asked ? Now look here, Grace, letâ€™s not go off the deep end. Weâ€™re 
keeping the robot until Gloria is older and I donâ€™t want the subject brought up 
again.â€ And with that he walked out of the room in a huff. 


Mrs. Weston met her husband at the door two evenings later. â€œYouâ€™ll have to 
listen to this, George. Thereâ€™s bad feeling in the village.â€ 

â€œAbout what?â€ asked Weston. He stepped into the washroom and drowned out 
any possible answer by the splash of water. 

Mrs. Weston waited. She said, â€œAbout Robbie.â€ 

Weston stepped out, towel in hand, face red and angry, â€œWhat are you talking 
about?â€ 

â€œOh, itâ€™s been building up and building up. Iâ€™ve tried to close my eyes to it, but 
Iâ€™m not going to any more. Most of the villagers consider Robbie dangerous. 
Children arenâ€™t allowed to go near our place in the evenings.â€ 

â€œWe trust our child with the thing.â€ 

â€œWell, people arenâ€™t reasonable about these things.â€ 

â€œThen to hell with them.â€ 

â€œSaying that doesnâ€™t solve the problem. Iâ€™ve got to do my shopping down 
there. Iâ€™ve got to meet them every day. And itâ€™s even worse in the city these days 
when it comes to robots. New York has just passed an ordinance keeping all 
robots off the streets between sunset and sunrise.â€ 

â€œAll right, but they canâ€™t stop us from keeping a robot in our home. â€”Grace, 
this is one of your campaigns. I recognize it. But itâ€™s no use. The answer is still 



no! Weâ€™re keeping Robbie!â€ 


And yet he loved his wifeâ€”and what was worse, his wife knew it. George 
Weston, after all was only a manâ€”poor thingâ€”and his wife made full use of 
every device which a clumsier and more scrupulous sex has learned, with reason 
and futility, to fear. 

Ten times in the ensuing week, he cried, â€œRobbie stays,â€”and thatâ€™s final\â€ and 
each time it was weaker and accompanied by a louder and more agonized groan. 

Came the day at last, when Weston approached his daughter guiltily and 
suggested a â€œbeautifulâ€ visivox show in the village. 

Gloria clapped her hands happily, â€œCan Robbie go?â€ 

â€œNo, dear,â€ he said, and winced at the sound of his voice, â€œthey wonâ€™t allow 
robots at the visivoxâ€”but you can tell him all about it when you get home.â€ He 
stumbled all over the last few words and looked away. 

Gloria came back from town bubbling over with enthusiasm, for the visivox 
had been a gorgeous spectacle indeed. 

She waited for her father to maneuver the jet-car into the sunken garage, â€œWait 
till I tell Robbie, Daddy. He would have liked it like anything. â€”Especially 
when Francis Fran was backing away so-o-o quietly, and backed right into one 
of the Feopard-Men and had to run.â€ She laughed again, â€œDaddy, are there really 
Feopard-Men on the Moon?â€ 

â€œProbably not,â€ said Weston absently. â€œItâ€™s just funny make-believe.â€ He 
couldnâ€™t take much longer with the car. Heâ€™d have to face it. 

Gloria ran across the lawn. â€œRobbie. â€”Robbie!â€ 

Then she stopped suddenly at the sight of a beautiful collie which regarded her 
out of serious brown eyes as it wagged its tail on the porch. 



â€œOh, what a nice dog!â€ Gloria climbed the steps, approached cautiously and 
patted it. â€œIs it for me, Daddy?â€ 

Her mother had joined them. â€œYes, it is, Gloria. Isnâ€™t it niceâ€”soft and furry. 
Itâ€™s very gentle. It likes little girls.â€ 

â€œCan he play games?â€ 

â€œSurely. He can do any number of tricks. Would you like to see some?â€ 

â€œRight away. I want Robbie to see him, too. â€” Robbie!â€ She stopped, 
uncertainly, and frowned, â€œIâ€™ll bet heâ€™s just staying in his room because heâ€™s mad 
at me for not taking him to the visivox. Youâ€™ll have to explain to him, Daddy. He 
might not believe me, but he knows if you say it, itâ€™s so.â€ 

Westonâ€™s lips grew tighter. He looked toward his wife but could not catch her 
eye. 

Gloria turned precipitously and ran down the basement steps, shouting as she 
went, â€œRobbieâ€” Come and see what Daddy and Mamma brought me. They 
brought me a dog, Robbie.â€ 

In a minute she had returned, a frightened little girl. â€œMamma, Robbie isnâ€™t in 
his room. Where is he?â€ There was no answer and George Weston coughed and 
was suddenly extremely interested in an aimlessly drifting cloud. Gloriaâ€™s voice 
quavered on the verge of tears, â€œWhereâ€™s Robbie, Mamma?â€ 

Mrs. Weston sat down and drew her daughter gently to her, â€œDonâ€™t feel bad, 
Gloria. Robbie has gone away, I think.â€ 

â€œGone away ? Where? Whereâ€™s he gone away, Mamma?â€ 

â€œNo one knows, darling. He just walked away. Weâ€™ve looked and weâ€™ve 
looked and weâ€™ve looked for him, but we canâ€™t find him.â€ 

â€œYou mean heâ€™ll never come back again?â€ Her eyes were round with horror. 

â€œWe may find him soon. Weâ€™ll keep looking for him. And meanwhile you can 
play with your nice new doggie. Look at him! His name is Lightning and he can 



But Gloriaâ€™s eyelids had overflown, â€œI donâ€™t want the nasty dogâ€”I want 
Robbie. I want you to find me Robbie.â€ Her feelings became too deep for words, 
and she spluttered into a shrill wail. 

Mrs. Weston glanced at her husband for help, but he merely shuffled his feet 
morosely and did not withdraw his ardent stare from the heavens, so she bent to 
the task of consolation, â€œWhy do you cry, Gloria? Robbie was only a machine, 
just a nasty old machine. He wasnâ€™t alive at all.â€ 

â€œHe was not no machine!â€ screamed Gloria, fiercely and ungrammatically. â€œHe 
was a person just like you and me and he was my friend. I want him back. Oh, 
Mamma, I want him back.â€ 

Her mother groaned in defeat and left Gloria to her sorrow. 

â€œLet her have her cry out,â€ she told her husband. â€œChildish griefs are never 
lasting. In a few days, sheâ€™ll forget that awful robot ever existed.â€ 

But time proved Mrs. Weston a bit too optimistic. To be sure, Gloria ceased 
crying, but she ceased smiling, too, and the passing days found her ever more 
silent and shadowy. Gradually, her attitude of passive unhappiness wore Mrs. 
Weston down and all that kept her from yielding was the impossibility of 
admitting defeat to her husband. 

Then, one evening, she flounced into the living room, sat down, folded her 
arms and looked boiling mad. 

Her husband stretched his neck in order to see her over his newspaper, â€œWhat 
now, Grace?â€ 

â€œItâ€™s that child, George. Iâ€™ve had to send back the dog today. Gloria positively 
couldnâ€™t stand the sight of him, she said. Sheâ€™s driving me into a nervous 
breakdown.â€ 

Weston laid down the paper and a hopeful gleam entered his eye, â€œMaybeâ€” 
Maybe we ought to get Robbie back. It might be done, you know. I can get in 
touch withâ€”â€ 



â€œNo!â€ she replied, grimly. â€œI wonâ€™t hear of it. Weâ€™re not giving up that easily. 
My child shall not be brought up by a robot if it takes years to break her of it.â€ 

Weston picked up his paper again with a disappointed air. â€œA year of this will 
have me prematurely gray.â€ 

â€œYouâ€™re a big help, George,â€ was the frigid answer. â€œWhat Gloria needs is a 
change of environment. Of course she canâ€™t forget Robbie here. How can she 
when every tree and rock reminds her of him? It is really the silliest situation I 
have ever heard of. Imagine a child pining away for the loss of a robot.â€ 

â€œWell, stick to the point. Whatâ€™s the change in environment youâ€™re planning?â€ 

â€œWeâ€™re going to take her to New York.â€ 

â€œThe city! In August! Say, do you know what New York is like in August? Itâ€™s 
unbearable.â€ 

â€œMillions do bear it.â€ 

â€œThey donâ€™t have a place like this to go to. If they didnâ€™t have to stay in New 
York, they wouldnâ€™t.â€ 

â€œWell, we have to. I say weâ€™re leaving nowâ€”or as soon as we can make the 
arrangements. In the city, Gloria will find sufficient interests and sufficient 
friends to perk her up and make her forget that machine.â€ 

â€œOh, Lord,â€ groaned the lesser half, â€œthose frying pavements!â€ 

â€œWe have to,â€ was the unshaken response. â€œGloria has lost five pounds in the 
last month and my little girlâ€™s health is more important to me than your 
comfort.â€ 

â€œItâ€™s a pity you didnâ€™t think of your little girlâ€™s health before you deprived her 
of her pet robot,â€ he mutteredâ€”but to himself. 


Gloria displayed immediate signs of improvement when told of the impending 



trip to the city. She spoke little of it, but when she did, it was always with lively 
anticipation. Again, she began to smile and to eat with something of her former 
appetite. 

Mrs. Weston hugged herself for joy and lost no opportunity to triumph over her 
still skeptical husband. 

â€œYou see, George, she helps with the packing like a little angel, and chatters 
away as if she hadnâ€™t a care in the world. Itâ€™s just as I told youâ€”all we need do 
is substitute other interests.â€ 

â€œHmpph,â€ was the skeptical response, â€œI hope so.â€ 

Preliminaries were gone through quickly. Arrangements were made for the 
preparation of their city home and a couple were engaged as housekeepers for 
the country home. When the day of the trip finally did come, Gloria was all but 
her old self again, and no mention of Robbie passed her lips at all. 

In high good humor the family took a taxi-gyro to the airport (Weston would 
have preferred using his own private â€™gyro, but it was only a two-seater with no 
room for baggage) and entered the waiting liner. 

â€œCome, Gloria,â€ called Mrs. Weston. â€œIâ€™ve saved you a seat near the window 
so you can watch the scenery.â€ 

Gloria trotted down the aisle cheerily, flattened her nose into a white oval 
against the thick clear glass, and watched with an intentness that increased as the 
sudden coughing of the motor drifted backward into the interior. She was too 
young to be frightened when the ground dropped away as if let through a trapÂ¬ 
door and she herself suddenly became twice her usual weight, but not too young 
to be mightily interested. It wasnâ€™t until the ground had changed into a tiny 
patch-work quilt that she withdrew her nose, and faced her mother again. 

â€œWill we soon be in the city, Mamma?â€ she asked, rubbing her chilled nose, 
and watching with interest as the patch of moisture which her breath had formed 
on the pane shrank slowly and vanished. 

â€œIn about half an hour, dear.â€ Then, with just the faintest trace of anxiety, 
â€œArenâ€™t you glad weâ€™re going? Donâ€™t you think youâ€™ll be very happy in the city 



with all the buildings and people and things to see? Weâ€™ll go to the visivox every 
day and see shows and go to the circus and the beach andâ€”â€ 


â€œYes, Mamma,â€ was Gloriaâ€™s unenthusiastic rejoinder. The liner passed over a 
bank of clouds at the moment, and Gloria was instantly absorbed in the usual 
spectacle of clouds underneath one. Then they were over clear sky again, and 
she turned to her mother with a sudden mysterious air of secret knowledge. 

â€œI know why weâ€™re going to the city, Mamma.â€ 

â€œDo you?â€ Mrs. Weston was puzzled. â€œWhy, dear?â€ 

â€œYou didnâ€™t tell me because you wanted it to be a surprise, but / know.â€ For a 
moment, she was lost in admiration at her own acute penetration, and then she 
laughed gaily. â€œWeâ€™re going to New York so we can find Robbie, arenâ€™t we? â€” 
With detectives.â€ 

The statement caught George Weston in the middle of a drink of water, with 
disastrous results. There was a sort of strangled gasp, a geyser of water, and then 
a bout of choking coughs. When all was over, he stood there, a red-faced, water- 
drenched and very, very annoyed person. 

Mrs. Weston maintained her composure, but when Gloria repeated her question 
in a more anxious tone of voice, she found her temper rather bent. 

â€œMaybe,â€ she retorted, tartly. â€œNow sit and be still, for Heavenâ€™s sake.â€ 


New York City, 1998 A.D., was a paradise for the sightseer more than ever in its 
history. Gloriaâ€™s parents realized this and made the most of it. 

On direct orders from his wife, George Weston arranged to have his business 
take care of itself for a month or so, in order to be free to spend the time in what 
he termed â€œdissipating Gloria to the verge of ruin.â€ Like everything else Weston 
did, this was gone about in an efficient, thorough, and business-like way. Before 
the month had passed, nothing that could be done had not been done. 



She was taken to the top of the half-mile tall Roosevelt Building, to gaze down 
in awe upon the jagged panorama of rooftops that blended far off in the fields of 
Long Island and the flatlands of New Jersey. They visited the zoos where Gloria 
stared in delicious fright at the â€œreal live lionâ€ (rather disappointed that the 
keepers fed him raw steaks, instead of human beings, as she had expected), and 
asked insistently and peremptorily to see â€œthe whale.â€ 

The various museums came in for their share of attention, together with the 
parks and the beaches and the aquarium. 

She was taken halfway up the Hudson in an excursion steamer fitted out in the 
archaism of the mad Twenties. She travelled into the stratosphere on an 
exhibition trip, where the sky turned deep purple and the stars came out and the 
misty earth below looked like a huge concave bowl. Down under the waters of 
the Long Island Sound she was taken in a glass-walled subsea vessel, where in a 
green and wavering world, quaint and curious sea-things ogled her and wiggled 
suddenly away. 

On a more prosaic level, Mrs. Weston took her to the department stores where 
she could revel in another type of fairyland. 

In fact, when the month had nearly sped, the Westons were convinced that 
everything conceivable had been done to take Gloriaâ€™s mind once and for all off 
the departed Robbieâ€”but they were not quite sure they had succeeded. 

The fact remained that wherever Gloria went, she displayed the most absorbed 
and concentrated interest in such robots as happened to be present. No matter 
how exciting the spectacle before her, nor how novel to her girlish eyes, she 
turned away instantly if the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of metallic 
movement. 

Mrs. Weston went out of her way to keep Gloria away from all robots. 

And the matter was finally climaxed in the episode at the Museum of Science 
and Industry. The Museum had announced a special â€œchildrenâ€™s programâ€ in 
which exhibits of scientific witchery scaled down to the child mind were to be 
shown. The Westons, of course, placed it upon their list of â€œabsolutely.â€ 



It was while the Westons were standing totally absorbed in the exploits of a 
powerful electro-magnet that Mrs. Weston suddenly became aware of the fact 
that Gloria was no longer with her. Initial panic gave way to calm decision and, 
enlisting the aid of three attendants, a careful search was begun. 

Gloria, of course, was not one to wander aimlessly, however. For her age, she 
was an unusually determined and purposeful girl, quite full of the maternal genes 
in that respect. She had seen a huge sign on the third floor, which had said, â€œThis 
Way to the Talking Robot.â€ Having spelled it out to herself and having noticed 
that her parents did not seem to wish to move in the proper direction, she did the 
obvious thing. Waiting for an opportune moment of parental distraction, she 
calmly disengaged herself and followed the sign. 


The Talking Robot was a tour de force, a thoroughly impractical device, 
possessing publicity value only. Once an hour, an escorted group stood before it 
and asked questions of the robot engineer in charge in careful whispers. Those 
the engineer decided were suitable for the robotâ€™s circuits were transmitted to the 
Talking Robot. 

It was rather dull. It may be nice to know that the square of fourteen is one 
hundred ninety-six, that the temperature at the moment is 72 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and the air pressure 30.02 inches of mercury, that the atomic weight of sodium is 
23, but one doesnâ€™t really need a robot for that. One especially does not need an 
unwieldy, totally immobile mass of wires and coils spreading over twenty-five 
square yards. 

Few people bothered to return for a second helping, but one girl in her middle 
teens sat quietly on a bench waiting for a third. She was the only one in the room 
when Gloria entered. 

Gloria did not look at her. To her at the moment, another human being was but 
an inconsiderable item. She saved her attention for this large thing with the 
wheels. For a moment, she hesitated in dismay. It didnâ€™t look like any robot she 
had ever seen. 


Cautiously and doubtfully she raised her treble voice, â€œPlease, Mr. Robot, sir, 



are you the Talking Robot, sir?â€ She wasnâ€™t sure, but it seemed to her that a 
robot that actually talked was worth a great deal of politeness. 

(The girl in her mid-teens allowed a look of intense concentration to cross her 
thin, plain face. She whipped out a small notebook and began writing in rapid 
pothooks.) 

There was an oily whir of gears and a mechanically timbered voice boomed 
out in words that lacked accent and intonation, â€œIâ€”amâ€”theâ€”robotâ€”thatâ€” 
talks.â€ 

Gloria stared at it ruefully. It did talk, but the sound came from inside 
somewheres. There was no face to talk to. She said, â€œCan you help me, Mr. 
Robot, sir?â€ 

The Talking Robot was designed to answer questions, and only such questions 
as it could answer had ever been put to it. It was quite confident of its ability, 
therefore, â€œIâ€”canâ€”helpâ€”you.â€ 

â€œThank you, Mr. Robot, sir. Have you seen Robbie?â€ 

â€œWhoâ€”is Robbie?â€ 

â€œHeâ€™s a robot, Mr. Robot, sir.â€ She stretched to tiptoes. â€œHeâ€™s about so high, 
Mr. Robot, sir, only higher, and heâ€™s very nice. Heâ€™s got a head, you know. I 
mean you havenâ€™t, but he has, Mr. Robot, sir.â€ 

The Talking Robot had been left behind, â€œAâ€”robot?â€ 

â€œYes, Mr. Robot, sir. A robot just like you, except he canâ€™t talk, of course, and 
â€”looks like a real person.â€ 

â€œAâ€”robotâ€”likeâ€”me?â€ 

â€œYes, Mr. Robot, sir.â€ 

To which the Talking Robotâ€™s only response was an erratic splutter and an 
occasional incoherent sound. The radical generalization offered it, i.e., its 
existence, not as a particular object, but as a member of a general group, was too 



much for it. Loyally, it tried to encompass the concept and half a dozen coils 
burnt out. Little warning signals were buzzing. 


(The girl in her mid-teens left at that point. She had enough for her Physics-1 
paper on â€œPractical Aspects of Robotics.â€ This paper was Susan Calvinâ€™s first of 
many on the subject.) 

Gloria stood waiting, with carefully concealed impatience, for the machineâ€™s 
answer when she heard the cry behind her of â€œThere she is,â€ and recognized that 
cry as her motherâ€™s. 

â€œWhat are you doing here, you bad girl?â€ cried Mrs. Weston, anxiety 
dissolving at once into anger. â€œDo you know you frightened your mamma and 
daddy almost to death? Why did you run away?â€ 

The robot engineer had also dashed in, tearing his hair, and demanding who of 
the gathering crowd had tampered with the machine. â€œCanâ€™t anybody read 
signs?â€ he yelled. â€œYouâ€™re not allowed in here without an attendant.â€ 

Gloria raised her grieved voice over the din, â€œI only came to see the Talking 
Robot, Mamma. I thought he might know where Robbie was because theyâ€™re 
both robots.â€ And then, as the thought of Robbie was suddenly brought 
forcefully home to her, she burst into a sudden storm of tears, â€œAnd I got to find 
Robbie, Mamma. I got to.â€ 

Mrs. Weston strangled a cry, and said, â€œOh, good Heavens. Come home, 
George. This is more than I can stand.â€ 

That evening, George Weston left for several hours, and the next morning, he 
approached his wife with something that looked suspiciously like smug 
complacence. 

â€œIâ€™ve got an idea, Grace.â€ 

â€œAbout what?â€ was the gloomy, uninterested query. 

â€œAbout Gloria.â€ 

â€œYouâ€™re not going to suggest buying back that robot?â€ 



â€œNo, of course not.â€ 


â€œThen go ahead. I might as well listen to you. Nothing Iâ€™ve done seems to have 
done any good.â€ 

â€œAll right. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been thinking. The whole trouble with Gloria is 
that she thinks of Robbie as a person and not as a machine. Naturally, she canâ€™t 
forget him. Now if we managed to convince her that Robbie was nothing more 
than a mess of steel and copper in the form of sheets and wires with electricity 
its juice of life, how long would her longings last? Itâ€™s the psychological attack, 
if you see my point.â€ 

â€œHow do you plan to do it?â€ 

â€œSimple. Where do you suppose I went last night? I persuaded Robertson of 
U.S. Robot and Mechanical Men, Inc., to arrange for a complete tour of his 
premises tomorrow. The three of us will go, and by the time weâ€™re through, 
Gloria will have it drilled into her that a robot is not alive.â€ 

Mrs. Westonâ€™s eyes widened gradually and something glinted in her eyes that 
was quite like sudden admiration, â€œWhy, George, thatâ€™s a good idea.â€ 

And George Westonâ€™s vest buttons strained. â€œOnly kind I have,â€ he said. 


Mr. Struthers was a conscientious General Manager and naturally inclined to be 
a bit talkative. The combination, therefore, resulted in a tour that was fully 
explained, perhaps even over-abundantly explained, at every step. However, 
Mrs. Weston was not bored. Indeed, she stopped him several times and begged 
him to repeat his statements in simpler language so that Gloria might understand. 
Under the influence of this appreciation of his narrative powers, Mr. Struthers 
expanded genially and became ever more communicative, if possible. 

George Weston, himself, showed a gathering impatience. 

â€œPardon me, Struthers,â€ he said, breaking into the middle of a lecture on the 
photo-electric cell, â€œhavenâ€™t you a section of the factory where only robot labor 



is employed?â€ 


â€œEh? Oh, yes! Yes, indeed!â€ He smiled at Mrs. Weston. â€œA vicious circle in a 
way, robots creating more robots. Of course, we are not making a general 
practice out of it. For one thing, the unions would never let us. But we can turn 
out a very few robots using robot labor exclusively, merely as a sort of scientific 
experiment. You see,â€ he tapped his pince-nez into one palm argumentatively, 
â€œwhat the labor unions donâ€™t realizeâ€”and I say this as a man who has always 
been very sympathetic with the labor movement in generalâ€”is that the advent of 
the robot, while involving some dislocation to begin with, will inevitablyâ€”â€ 

â€œYes, Struthers,â€ said Weston, â€œbut about that section of the factory you speak 
ofâ€”may we see it? It would be very interesting, Iâ€™m sure.â€ 

â€œYes! Yes, of course!â€ Mr. Struthers replaced his pince-nez in one convulsive 
movement and gave vent to a soft cough of discomfiture. â€œFollow me, please.â€ 

He was comparatively quiet while leading the three through a long corridor 
and down a flight of stairs. Then, when they had entered a large well-lit room 
that buzzed with metallic activity, the sluices opened and the flood of 
explanation poured forth again. 

â€œThere you are!â€ he said with pride in his voice. â€œRobots only! Five men act as 
overseers and they donâ€™t even stay in this room. In five years, that is, since we 
began this project, not a single accident has occurred. Of course, the robots here 
assembled are comparatively simple, but...â€ 

The General Managerâ€™s voice had long died to a rather soothing murmur in 
Gloriaâ€™s ears. The whole trip seemed rather dull and pointless to her, though 
there were many robots in sight. None were even remotely like Robbie, though, 
and she surveyed them with open contempt. 

In this room, there werenâ€™t any people at all, she noticed. Then her eyes fell 
upon six or seven robots busily engaged at a round table halfway across the 
room. They widened in incredulous surprise. It was a big room. She couldnâ€™t see 
for sure, but one of the robots looked likeâ€”looked like â€”it was! 

â€œRobbie!â€ Her shriek pierced the air, and one of the robots about the table 



faltered and dropped the tool he was holding. Gloria went almost mad with joy. 
Squeezing through the railing before either parent could stop her, she dropped 
lightly to the floor a few feet below, and ran toward her Robbie, arms waving 
and hair flying. 

And the three horrified adults, as they stood frozen in their tracks, saw what 
the excited little girl did not see,â€”a huge, lumbering tractor bearing blindly 
down upon its appointed track. 

It took split-seconds for Weston to come to his senses, and those split-seconds 
meant everything, for Gloria could not be overtaken. Although Weston vaulted 
the railing in a wild attempt, it was obviously hopeless. Mr. Struthers signalled 
wildly to the overseers to stop the tractor, but the overseers were only human and 
it took time to act. 

It was only Robbie that acted immediately and with precision. 

With metal legs eating up the space between himself and his little mistress he 
charged down from the opposite direction. Everything then happened at once. 
With one sweep of an arm, Robbie snatched up Gloria, slackening his speed not 
one iota, and, consequently, knocking every breath of air out of her. Weston, not 
quite comprehending all that was happening, felt, rather than saw, Robbie brush 
past him, and came to a sudden bewildered halt. The tractor intersected Gloriaâ€™s 
path half a second after Robbie had, rolled on ten feet further and came to a 
grinding, long drawn-out stop. 

Gloria regained her breath, submitted to a series of passionate hugs on the part 
of both her parents and turned eagerly toward Robbie. As far as she was 
concerned, nothing had happened except that she had found her friend. 

But Mrs. Westonâ€™s expression had changed from one of relief to one of dark 
suspicion. She turned to her husband, and, despite her disheveled and 
undignified appearance, managed to look quite formidable, â€œYou engineered this, 
didnâ€™t you?â€ 

George Weston swabbed at a hot forehead with his handkerchief. His hand was 
unsteady, and his lips could curve only into a tremulous and exceedingly weak 
smile. 



Mrs. Weston pursued the thought, â€œRobbie wasnâ€™t designed for engineering or 
construction work. He couldnâ€™t be of any use to them. You had him placed there 
deliberately so that Gloria would find him. You know you did.â€ 

â€œWell, I did,â€ said Weston. â€œBut, Grace, how was I to know the reunion would 
be so violent? And Robbie has saved her life; youâ€™ll have to admit that. You 
canâ€™t send him away again.â€ 

Grace Weston considered. She turned toward Gloria and Robbie and watched 
them abstractedly for a moment. Gloria had a grip about the robotâ€™s neck that 
would have asphyxiated any creature but one of metal, and was prattling 
nonsense in half-hysterical frenzy. Robbieâ€™s chrome-steel arms (capable of 
bending a bar of steel two inches in diameter into a pretzel) wound about the 
little girl gently and lovingly, and his eyes glowed a deep, deep red. 

â€œWell,â€ said Mrs. Weston, at last, â€œI guess he can stay with us until he rusts.â€ 


Susan Calvin shrugged her shoulders, â€œOf course, he didnâ€™t That was 1998. By 
2002, we had invented the mobile speaking robot which, of course, made all the 
non-speaking models out of date, and which seemed to be the final straw as far 
as the non-robot elements were concerned. Most of the world governments 
banned robot use on Earth for any purpose other than scientific research 
between 2003 and 2007. â€ 

â€œSo that Gloria had to give up Robbie eventually?â€ 

â€œIâ€™m afraid so. I imagine, however, that it was easier for her at the age of 
fifteen than at eight. Still, it was a stupid and unnecessary attitude on the part of 
humanity. U.S. Robots hit its low point, financially, just about the time I joined 
them in 2007. At first, I thought my job might come to a sudden end in a matter 
of months, but then we simply developed the extra-Terrestrial market.â€ 

â€œAnd then you were set, of course. â€ 

â€œNot quite. We began by trying to adapt the models we had on hand. Those 
first speaking models, for instance. They were about twelve feet high, very 



clumsy and not much good. We sent them out to Mercury to help build the mining 
station there, but that failed. â€ 

I looked up in surprise, â€œIt did? Why, Mercury Mines is a multi-billion dollar 
concern. â€ 

â€œIt is now, but it was a second attempt that succeeded. If you want to know 
about that, young man, Iâ€™d advise you to look up Gregory Powell. He and 
Michael Donovan handled our most difficult cases in the teens and twenties. I 
havenâ€™t heard from Donovan in years, but Powell is living right here in New 
York. Heâ€™s a grandfather now, which is a thought difficult to get used to. I can 
only think of him as a rather young man. Of course, I was younger, too. â€ 

I tried to keep her talking, â€œIf you would give me the bare bones, Dr. Calvin, I 
can have Mr. Powell fill it in afterward. â€ (And this was exactly what I later did.) 

She spread her thin hands out upon the desk and looked at them. â€œThere are 
two or three, â€ she said, â€œthat I know a little about. â€ 

â€œStart with Mercury, â€ I suggested. 

â€œWell, I think it was in 2015 that the Second Mercury Expedition was sent out. 
It was exploratory and financed in part by U. S. Robots and in part by Solar 
Minerals. It consisted of a new-type robot, still experimental; Gregory Powell; 
Michael Donovan â€”â€ 



RUNAROUND 


It was one of Gregory Powellâ€™s favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained 
from excitement, so when Mike Donovan came leaping down the stairs toward 
him, red hair matted with perspiration, Powell frowned. 

â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€ he said. â€œBreak a fingernail?â€ 

â€œYaaaah,â€ snarled Donovan, feverishly. â€œWhat have you been doing in the 
sublevels all day?â€ He took a deep breath and blurted out, â€œSpeedy never 
returned.â€ 

Powellâ€™s eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs; then he 
recovered and resumed his upward steps. He didnâ€™t speak until he reached the 
head of the flight, and then: 

â€œYou sent him after the selenium?â€ 

â€œYes.â€ 

â€œAnd how long has he been out?â€ 

â€œFive hours now.â€ 

Silence! This was a devil of a situation. Here they were, on Mercury exactly 
twelve hoursâ€”and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble. 
Mercury had long been the jinx world of the System, but this was drawing it 
rather strongâ€”even for a jinx. 

Powell said, â€œStart at the beginning, and letâ€™s get this straight.â€ 

They were in the radio room nowâ€”with its already subtly antiquated 
equipment, untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival. Even ten years, 
technologically speaking, meant so much. Compare Speedy with the type of 



robot they must have had back in 2005. But then, advances in robotics these days 
were tremendous. Powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly. The air 
of disuse that touched everything about the roomâ€”and the entire Stationâ€”was 
infinitely depressing. 

Donovan must have felt it. He began: â€œI tried to locate him by radio, but it was 
no go. Radio isnâ€™t any good on the Mercury Sunsideâ€”not past two miles, 
anyway. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons the First Expedition failed. And we canâ€™t put 
up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yetâ€”â€ 

â€œSkip all that. What did you get?â€ 

â€œI located the unorganized body signal in the short wave. It was no good for 
anything except his position. I kept track of him that way for two hours and 
plotted the results on the map.â€ 

There was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocketâ€”a relic of the 
unsuccessful First Expeditionâ€”and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious 
force, spreading it flat with the palm of his hand. Powell, hands clasped across 
his chest, watched it at long range. 

Donovanâ€™s pencil pointed nervously. â€œThe red cross is the selenium pool. You 
marked it yourself.â€ 

â€œWhich one is it?â€ interrupted Powell. â€œThere were three that MacDougal 
located for us before he left.â€ 

â€œI sent Speedy to the nearest, naturally. Seventeen miles away. But what 
difference does that make?â€ There was tension in his voice. â€œThere are the 
penciled dots that mark Speedyâ€™s position.â€ 

And for the first time Powellâ€™s artificial aplomb was shaken and his hands shot 
forward for the map. 

â€œAre you serious? This is impossible.â€ 

â€œThere it is,â€ growled Donovan. 


The little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red 



cross of the selenium pool. And Powellâ€™s fingers went to his brown mustache, 
the unfailing signal of anxiety. 

Donovan added: â€œIn the two hours I checked on him, he circled that damned 
pool four times. It seems likely to me that heâ€™ll keep that up forever. Do you 
realize the position weâ€™re in?â€ 

Powell looked up shortly, and said nothing. Oh, yes, he realized the position 
they were in. It worked itself out as simply as a syllogism. The photo-cell banks 
that alone stood between the full power of Mercuryâ€™s monstrous sun and 
themselves were shot to hell. The only thing that could save them was selenium. 
The only thing that could get the selenium was Speedy. If Speedy didnâ€™t come 
back, no selenium. No selenium, no photo-cell banks. No photo-banksâ€”well, 
death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in. 

Donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with 
bitterness. â€œWeâ€™ll be the laughingstock of the System, Greg. How can everything 
have gone so wrong so soon? The great team of Powell and Donovan is sent out 
to Mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the Sunside Mining Station 
with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day. A purely 
routine job, too. Weâ€™ll never live it down.â€ 

â€œWe wonâ€™t have to, perhaps,â€ replied Powell, quietly. â€œIf we donâ€™t do 
something quickly, living anything downâ€”or even just plain livingâ€”will be out 
of the question.â€ 

â€œDonâ€™t be stupid! If you feel funny about it, Greg, I donâ€™t. It was criminal, 
sending us out here with only one robot. And it was your bright idea that we 
could handle the photo-cell banks ourselves.â€ 

â€œNow youâ€™re being unfair. It was a mutual decision and you know it. All we 
needed was a kilogram of selenium, a Stillhead Dielectrode Plate and about three 
hoursâ€™ timeâ€”and there are pools of pure selenium all over Sunside. 
MacDougalâ€™s spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes, didnâ€™t it? 
What the devil! We couldnâ€™t have waited for next conjunction.â€ 

â€œWell, what are we going to do? Powell, youâ€™ve got an idea. I know you have, 
or you wouldnâ€™t be so calm. Youâ€™re no more a hero than I am. Go on, spill it!â€ 



â€œWe canâ€™t go after Speedy ourselves, Mikeâ€”not on the Sunside. Even the new 
insosuits arenâ€™t good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight. But you 
know the old saying, â€˜Set a robot to catch a robot.â€™ Look, Mike, maybe things 
arenâ€™t so bad. Weâ€™ve got six robots down in the sublevels, that we may be able to 
use, if they work. If they work.â€ 

There was a glint of sudden hope in Donovanâ€™s eyes. â€œYou mean six robots 
from the First Expedition. Are you sure? They may be subrobotic machines. Ten 
years is a long time as far as robot-types are concerned, you know.â€ 

â€œNo, theyâ€™re robots. Iâ€™ve spent all day with them and I know. Theyâ€™ve got 
positronic brains: primitive, of course.â€ He placed the map in his pocket. â€œLetâ€™s 
go down.â€ 


The robots were on the lowest sublevelâ€”all six of them surrounded by musty 
packing cases of uncertain content. They were large, extremely so, and even 
though they were in a sitting position on the floor, legs straddled out before 
them, their heads were a good seven feet in the air. 

Donovan whistled. â€œLook at the size of them, will you? The chests must be ten 
feet around.â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s because theyâ€™re supplied with the old McGuffy gears. Iâ€™ve been over 
the insidesâ€”crummiest set youâ€™ve ever seen.â€ 

â€œHave you powered them yet?â€ 

â€œNo. There wasnâ€™t any reason to. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with 
them. Even the diaphragm is in reasonable order. They might talk.â€ 

He had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke, inserted the two- 
inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robotâ€™s life. 
There was difficulty in fitting it, but he managed, and then screwed the plate 
back on again in laborious fashion. The radio controls of more modern models 
had not been heard of ten years earlier. And then to the other five. 



Donovan said uneasily, â€œThey havenâ€™t moved.â€ 


â€œNo orders to do so,â€ replied Powell, succinctly. He went back to the first in 
the line and struck him on the chest. â€œYou! Do you hear me?â€ 

The monsterâ€™s head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on Powell. 
Then, in a harsh, squawking voiceâ€”like that of a medieval phonographâ€”he 
grated, â€œYes, Master!â€ 

Powell grinned humorlessly at Donovan. â€œDid you get that? Those were the 
days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on Earth 
would be banned. The makers were fighting that and they built good, healthy 
slave complexes into the damned machines.â€ 

â€œIt didnâ€™t help them,â€ muttered Donovan. 

â€œNo, it didnâ€™t, but they sure tried.â€ He turned once more to the robot. â€œGet up!â€ 

The robot towered upward slowly and Donovanâ€™s head craned and his 
puckered lips whistled. 

Powell said: â€œCan you go out upon the surface? In the light?â€ 

There was consideration while the robotâ€™s slow brain worked. Then, â€œYes, 
Master.â€ 

â€œGood. Do you know what a mile is?â€ 

Another consideration, and another slow answer. â€œYes, Master.â€ 

â€œWe will take you up to the surface then, and indicate a direction. You will go 
about seventeen miles, and somewhere in that general region you will meet 
another robot, smaller than yourself. You understand so far?â€ 

â€œYes, Master.â€ 

â€œYou will find this robot and order him to return. If he does not wish to, you 
are to bring him back by force.â€ 



Donovan clutched at Powellâ€™s sleeve. â€œWhy not send him for the selenium 
direct?â€ 

â€œBecause I want Speedy back, nitwit. I want to find out whatâ€™s wrong with 
him.â€ And to the robot, â€œAll right, you, follow me.â€ 

The robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled: â€œPardon, Master, but I 
cannot. You must mount first.â€ His clumsy arms had come together with a 
thwack, blunt fingers interlacing. 

Powell stared and then pinched at his mustache. â€œUh . . . oh!â€ 

Donovanâ€™s eyes bulged. â€œWeâ€™ve got to ride him? Like a horse?â€ 

â€œI guess thatâ€™s the idea. I donâ€™t know why, though. I canâ€™t seeâ€”Yes, I do. I told 
you they were playing up robot-safety in those days. Evidently, they were going 
to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about, without a 
mahout on their shoulders all the time. What do we do now?â€ 

â€œThatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been thinking,â€ muttered Donovan. â€œWe canâ€™t go out on the 
surface, with a robot or without. Oh, for the love of Peteâ€â€”and he snapped his 
fingers twice. He grew excited. â€œGive me that map youâ€™ve got. I havenâ€™t studied 
it for two hours for nothing. This is a Mining Station. Whatâ€™s wrong with using 
the tunnels?â€ 

The Mining Station was a black circle on the map, and the light dotted lines 
that were tunnels stretched out about it in spiderweb fashion. 

Donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map. â€œLook,â€ he said, 
â€œthe small black dots are openings to the surface, and hereâ€™s one maybe three 
miles away from the selenium pool. Thereâ€™s a number hereâ€”youâ€™d think theyâ€™d 
write largerâ€”13a. If the robots know their way around hereâ€”â€ 

Powell shot the question and received the dull â€œYes, Master,â€ in reply. â€œGet 
your insosuit,â€ he said with satisfaction. 

It was the first time either had worn the insosuitsâ€”which marked one time 
more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day beforeâ€”and they 
tested their limp movements uncomfortably. 



The insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit; but 
withal considerably lighter, due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in 
composition. Composed of heat-resistant plastic and chemically treated cork 
layers, and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone-dry, the 
insosuits could withstand the full glare of Mercuryâ€™s sun for twenty minutes. 
Five to ten minutes more, as well, without actually killing the occupant. 

And still the robotâ€™s hands formed the stirrup, nor did he betray the slightest 
atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which Powell had been converted. 

Powellâ€™s radio-harshened voice boomed out: â€œAre you ready to take us to Exit 
13a?â€ 

â€œYes, Master.â€ 

Good, thought Powell; they might lack radio control but at least they were 
fitted for radio reception. â€œMount one or the other, Mike,â€ he said to Donovan. 

He placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward. He found the 
seat comfortable; there was the humped back of the robot, evidently shaped for 
the purpose, a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two 
elongated â€œearsâ€ whose purpose now seemed obvious. 

Powell seized the ears and twisted the head. His mount turned ponderously. 
â€œLead on, Macduff.â€ But he did not feel at all lighthearted. 

The gigantic robots moved slowly, with mechanical precision, through the 
doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot, so that the two men had to duck 
hurriedly, along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed 
monotonously and into the air lock. 

The long, airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home 
forcefully to Powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the First 
Expedition, with their crude robots and their start-from-scratch necessities. They 
might have been a failure, but their failure was a good deal better than the usual 
mn of the Systemâ€™s successes. 


The robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps 
that never lengthened. 



Powell said: â€œNotice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the 
temperature is Earth-normal. Itâ€™s probably been like this all the ten years that this 
place has remained empty.â€ 

â€œHowâ€™s that?â€ 

â€œCheap energy; cheapest in the System. Sunpower, you know, and on 
Mercuryâ€™s Sunside, sunpower is something. Thatâ€™s why the Station was built in 
the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain. Itâ€™s really a huge energy 
converter. The heat is turned into electricity, light, mechanical work and what 
have you; so that energy is supplied and the Station is cooled in a simultaneous 
process.â€ 

â€œLook,â€ said Donovan. â€œThis is all very educational, but would you mind 
changing the subject? It so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk 
about is carried on by the photo-cell banks mainlyâ€”and that is a tender subject 
with me at the moment.â€ 

Powell grunted vaguely, and when Donovan broke the resulting silence, it was 
to change the subject completely. â€œListen, Greg. What the devilâ€™s wrong with 
Speedy, anyway? I canâ€™t understand it.â€ 

Itâ€™s not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit, but Powell tried it. â€œI donâ€™t 
know, Mike. You know heâ€™s perfectly adapted to a Mercurian environment. Heat 
doesnâ€™t mean anything to him and heâ€™s built for the light gravity and the broken 
ground. Heâ€™s foolproofâ€”or, at least, he should be.â€ 

Silence fell. This time, silence that lasted. 

â€œMaster,â€ said the robot, â€œwe are here.â€ 

â€œEh?â€ Powell snapped out of a semidrowse. â€œWell, get us out of hereâ€”out to 
the surface.â€ 

They found themselves in a tiny substation, empty, airless, ruined. Donovan 
had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light 
of his pocket flash. 



â€œMeteorite, do you suppose?â€ he had asked. 

Powell shrugged. â€œTo hell with that. It doesnâ€™t matter. Letâ€™s get out.â€ 

A towering cliff of a black, basaltic rock cut off the sunlight, and the deep 
night shadow of an airless world surrounded them. Before them, the shadow 
reached out and ended in knife-edge abruptness into an all-but-unbearable blaze 
of white light, that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground. 

â€œSpace!â€ gasped Donovan. â€œIt looks like snow.â€ And it did. 

Powellâ€™s eyes swept the jagged glitter of Mercury to the horizon and winced at 
the gorgeous brilliance. 

â€œThis must be an unusual area,â€ he said. â€œThe general albedo of Mercury is 
low and most of the soil is gray pumice. Something like the Moon, you know. 
Beautiful, isnâ€™t it?â€ 

He was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates. Beautiful or not, a look 
at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a 
minute. 

Donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist. â€œHoly smokes, 
the temperature is eighty centigrade!â€ 

Powell checked his own and said: â€œUm-m-m. A little high. Atmosphere, you 
know.â€ 

â€œOn Mercury? Are you nuts?â€ 

â€œMercury isnâ€™t really airless,â€ explained Powell, in absentminded fashion. He 
was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate, and the bloated fingers 
of the insosuit were clumsy at it. â€œThere is a thin exhalation that clings to its 
surfaceâ€”vapors of the more volatile elements and compounds that are heavy 
enough for Mercurian gravity to retain. You know: selenium, iodine, mercury, 
gallium, potassium, bismuth, volatile oxides. The vapors sweep into the shadows 
and condense, giving up heat. Itâ€™s a sort of gigantic still. In fact, if you use your 
flash, youâ€™ll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with, say, hoar- 
sulphur, or maybe quick-silver dew. 



â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter, though. Our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely.â€ 


Powell had adjusted the binocular attachments, so that he seemed as eye- 
stalked as a snail. 

Donovan watched tensely. â€œSee anything?â€ 

The other did not answer immediately, and when he did, his voice was anxious 
and thoughtful. â€œThereâ€™s a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium 
pool. Itâ€™s in the right place. But I donâ€™t see Speedy.â€ 

Powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view, till he was 
standing in unsteady fashion upon his robotâ€™s shoulders. Legs straddled wide, 
eyes straining, he said: â€œI think ... I thinkâ€” Yes, itâ€™s definitely he. Heâ€™s coming 
this way.â€ 

Donovan followed the pointing finger. He had no binoculars, but there was a 
tiny moving dot, black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground. 

â€œI see him,â€ he yelled. â€œLetâ€™s get going!â€ 

Powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again, and his 
suited hand slapped against the Gargantuanâ€™s barrel chest. â€œGet going!â€ 

â€œGiddy-ap,â€ yelled Donovan, and thumped his heels, spur fashion. 


The robots started off, the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the 
airlessness, for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound. 
There was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing. 

â€œFaster,â€ yelled Donovan. The rhythm did not change. 

â€œNo use,â€ cried Powell, in reply. â€œThese junk heaps are only geared to one 
speed. Do you think theyâ€™re equipped with selective flexors?â€ 

They had burst through the shadow, and the sunlight came down in a white-hot 
wash and poured liquidly about them. 



Donovan ducked involuntarily. â€œWow! Is it imagination or do I feel heat?â€ 


â€œYouâ€™ll feel more presently,â€ was the grim reply. â€œKeep your eye on Speedy.â€ 

Robot SPD 13 was near enough to be seen in detail now. His graceful, 
streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across 
the broken ground. His name was derived from his serial initials, of course, but it 
was apt, nevertheless, for the SPD models were among the fastest robots turned 
out by the United States Robot & Mechanical Men Corp. 

â€œHey, Speedy,â€ howled Donovan, and waved a frantic hand. 

â€œSpeedy!â€ shouted Powell. â€œCome here!â€ 

The distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down 
momentarilyâ€”more by the efforts of Speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty- 
year-old antique mounts of Donovan and Powell. 

They were close enough now to notice that Speedyâ€™s gait included a peculiar 
rolling stagger, a noticeable side-to-side lurchâ€”and then, as Powell waved his 
hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact head-set radio sender, in 
preparation for another shout, Speedy looked up and saw them. 

Speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a momentâ€”with just a tiny, 
unsteady weave, as though he were swaying in a light wind. 

Powell yelled: â€œAll right, Speedy. Come here, boy.â€ 

Whereupon Speedyâ€™s robot voice sounded in Powellâ€™s earphones for the first 
time. 

It said: â€œHot dog, letâ€™s play games. You catch me and I catch you; no love can 
cut our knife in two. For Iâ€™m Little Buttercup, sweet Little Buttercup. Whoops!â€ 
Turning on his heel, he sped off in the direction from which he had come, with a 
speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust. 

And his last words as he receded into the distance were, â€œThere grew a little 
flower â€™neath a great oak tree,â€ followed by a curious metallic clicking that 
might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup. 



Donovan said weakly: â€œWhere did he pick up the Gilbert and Sullivan? Say, 
Greg, he ... heâ€™s drunk or something.â€ 

â€œIf you hadnâ€™t told me,â€ was the bitter response, â€œIâ€™d never realize it. Letâ€™s get 
back to the cliff. Iâ€™m roasting.â€ 

It was Powell who broke the desperate silence. â€œIn the first place,â€ he said, 
â€œSpeedy isnâ€™t drunkâ€”not in the human senseâ€”because heâ€™s a robot, and robots 
donâ€™t get drunk. However, thereâ€™s something wrong with him which is the 
robotic equivalent of drunkenness.â€ 

â€œTo me, heâ€™s drunk,â€ stated Donovan, emphatically, â€œand all I know is that he 
thinks weâ€™re playing games. And weâ€™re not. Itâ€™s a matter of life and very 
gmesome death.â€ 

â€œAll right. Donâ€™t hurry me. A robotâ€™s only a robot. Once we find out whatâ€™s 
wrong with him, we can fix it and go on.â€ 

â€œOnce, â€ said Donovan, sourly. 

Powell ignored him. â€œSpeedy is perfectly adapted to normal Mercurian 
environment. But this regionâ€â€”and his arm swept wideâ€”â€œis definitely 
abnormal. Thereâ€™s our clue. Now where do these crystals come from? They 
might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid; but where would you get liquid 
so hot that it would cool in Mercuryâ€™s sun?â€ 

â€œVolcanic action,â€ suggested Donovan, instantly, and Powellâ€™s body tensed. 

â€œOut of the mouths of sucklings,â€ he said in a small, strange voice and 
remained very still for five minutes. 

Then, he said, â€œListen, Mike, what did you say to Speedy when you sent him 
after the selenium?â€ 

Donovan was taken aback. â€œWell damn itâ€”I donâ€™t know. I just told him to get 
it.â€ 


â€œYes, I know. But how? Try to remember the exact words.â€ 



â€œI said ... uh ... I said: â€˜Speedy, we need some selenium. You can get it such- 
and-such a place. Go get it.â€™ Thatâ€™s all. What more did you want me to say?â€ 

â€œYou didnâ€™t put any urgency into the order, did you?â€ 

â€œWhat for? It was pure routine.â€ 

Powell sighed. â€œWell, it canâ€™t be helped nowâ€”but weâ€™re in a fine fix.â€ He had 
dismounted from his robot, and was sitting, back against the cliff. Donovan 
joined him and they linked arms. In the distance the burning sunlight seemed to 
wait cat-and-mouse for them, and just next to them, the two giant robots were 
invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them, 
unblinking, unwavering and unconcerned. 

Unconcerned! As was all this poisonous Mercury, as large in jinx as it was 
small in size. 

Powellâ€™s radio voice was tense in Donovanâ€™s ear: â€œNow, look, letâ€™s start with 
the three fundamental Rules of Roboticsâ€”the three rules that are built most 
deeply into a robotâ€™s positronic brain.â€ In the darkness, his gloved fingers ticked 
off each point. 

â€œWe have: One, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to harm.â€ 

â€œRight!â€ 

â€œTwo,â€ continued Powell, â€œa robot must obey the orders given it by human 
beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.â€ 

â€œRight!â€ 

â€œAnd three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection 
does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.â€ 

â€œRight! Now where are we?â€ 


â€œExactly at the explanation. The conflict between the various rules is ironed 
out by the different positronic potentials in the brain. Weâ€™ll say that a robot is 



walking into danger and knows it. The automatic potential that Rule 3 sets up 
turns him back. But suppose you order him to walk into that danger. In that case, 
Rule 2 sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot 
follows orders at the risk of existence.â€ 

â€œWell, I know that. What about it?â€ 

â€œLetâ€™s take Speedyâ€™s case. Speedy is one of the latest models, extremely 
specialized, and as expensive as a battleship. Itâ€™s not a thing to be lightly 
destroyed.â€ 

â€œSo?â€ 

â€œSo Rule 3 has been strengthenedâ€”that was specifically mentioned, by the 
way, in the advance notices on the SPD modelsâ€”so that his allergy to danger is 
unusually high. At the same time, when you sent him out after the selenium, you 
gave him his order casually and without special emphasis, so that the Rule 2 
potential set-up was rather weak. Now, hold on; Iâ€™m just stating facts.â€ 

â€œAll right, go ahead. I think I get it.â€ 

â€œYou see how it works, donâ€™t you? Thereâ€™s some sort of danger centering at the 
selenium pool. It increases as he approaches, and at a certain distance from it the 
Rule 3 potential, unusually high to start with, exactly balances the Rule 2 
potential, unusually low to start with.â€ 

Donovan rose to his feet in excitement. â€œAnd it strikes an equilibrium. I see. 
Rule 3 drives him back and Rule 2 drives him forwardâ€”â€ 

â€œSo he follows a circle around the selenium pool, staying on the locus of all 
points of potential equilibrium. And unless we do something about it, heâ€™ll stay 
on that circle forever, giving us the good old runaround.â€ Then, more 
thoughtfully: â€œAnd that, by the way, is what makes him drunk. At potential 
equilibrium, half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter. Iâ€™m not a 
robot specialist, but that seems obvious. Probably heâ€™s lost control of just those 
parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has. Ve-e-ery pretty.â€ 


â€œBut whatâ€™s the danger? If we knew what he was running fromâ€”â€ 



â€œYou suggested it. Volcanic action. Somewhere right above the selenium pool 
is a seepage of gas from the bowels of Mercury. Sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide 
â€”and carbon monoxide. Lots of itâ€”and at this temperature.â€ 

Donovan gulped audibly. â€œCarbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron 
carbonyl.â€ 

â€œAnd a robot,â€ added Powell, â€œis essentially iron.â€ Then, grimly: â€œThereâ€™s 
nothing like deduction. Weâ€™ve determined everything about our problem but the 
solution. We canâ€™t get the selenium ourselves. Itâ€™s still too far. We canâ€™t send 
these robot horses, because they canâ€™t go themselves, and they canâ€™t carry us fast 
enough to keep us from crisping. And we canâ€™t catch Speedy, because the dope 
thinks weâ€™re playing games, and he can run sixty miles to our four.â€ 

â€œIf one of us goes,â€ began Donovan, tentatively, â€œand comes back cooked, 
thereâ€™ll still be the other.â€ 

â€œYes,â€ came the sarcastic reply, â€œit would be a most tender sacrificeâ€”except 
that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reached the 
pool, and I donâ€™t think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without 
orders. Figure it out! Weâ€™re two or three miles from the poolâ€”call it twoâ€”the 
robot travels at four miles an hour; and we can last twenty minutes in our suits. It 
isnâ€™t only the heat, remember. Solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and 
below is poison.â€ 

â€œUm-m-m,â€ said Donovan, â€œten minutes short.â€ 

â€œAs good as an eternity. And another thing. In order for Rule 3 potential to 
have stopped Speedy where it did, there must be an appreciable amount of 
carbon monoxide in the metal-vapor atmosphereâ€”and there must be an 
appreciable corrosive action therefore. Heâ€™s been out hours nowâ€”and how do 
we know when a knee joint, for instance, wonâ€™t be thrown out of kilter and keel 
him over. Itâ€™s not only a question of thinkingâ€”weâ€™ve got to think fastiâ€ 

Deep, dark, dank, dismal silence! 

Donovan broke it, voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless. He 
said: â€œAs long as we canâ€™t increase Rule 2 potential by giving further orders, 



how about working the other way? If we increase the danger, we increase Rule 3 
potential and drive him backward.â€ 

Powellâ€™s visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question. 

â€œYou see,â€ came the cautious explanation, â€œall we need to do to drive him out 
of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity. 
Well, back at the Station thereâ€™s a complete analytical laboratory.â€ 

â€œNaturally,â€ assented Powell. â€œItâ€™s a Mining Station.â€ 

â€œAll right. There must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations.â€ 

â€œHoly space! Mike, youâ€™re a genius.â€ 

â€œSo-so,â€ admitted Donovan, modestly. â€œItâ€™s just a case of remembering that 
oxalic acid on heating decomposes into carbon dioxide, water, and good old 
carbon monoxide. College chem, you know.â€ 

Powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster 
robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machineâ€™s thigh. 

â€œHey,â€ he shouted, â€œcan you throw?â€ 

â€œMaster?â€ 

â€œNever mind.â€ Powell damned the robotâ€™s molasses-slow brain. He scrabbled 
up a jagged brick-size rock. â€œTake this,â€ he said, â€œand hit the patch of bluish 
crystals just across the crooked fissure. You see it?â€ 

Donovan pulled at his shoulder. â€œToo far, Greg. Itâ€™s almost half a mile off.â€ 

â€œQuiet,â€ replied Powell. â€œItâ€™s a case of Mercurian gravity and a steel throwing 
arm. Watch, will you?â€ 

The robotâ€™s eyes were measuring the distance with machinely accurate 
stereoscopy. His arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back. 
In the darkness, the robotâ€™s motions went unseen, but there was a sudden 
thumping sound as he shifted his weight, and seconds later the rock flew blackly 



into the sunlight. There was no air resistance to slow it down, nor wind to turn it 
asideâ€”and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of 
the â€œblue patch.â€ 


Powell yelled happily and shouted, â€œLetâ€™s go back after the oxalic acid, Mike.â€ 

And as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels, 
Donovan said grimly: â€œSpeedyâ€™s been hanging about on this side of the selenium 
pool, ever since we chased after him. Did you see him?â€ 

â€œYes.â€ 

â€œI guess he wants to play games. Well, weâ€™ll play him games!â€ 


They were back hours later, with three-liter jars of the white chemical and a pair 
of long faces. The photo-cell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had 
seemed likely. The two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the 
waiting Speedy in silence and with grim purpose. 

Speedy galloped slowly toward them. â€œHere we are again. Wheel Iâ€™ve made a 
little list, the piano organist; all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your 
face.â€ 

â€œWeâ€™ll puff something in your face,â€ muttered Donovan. â€œHeâ€™s limping, Greg.â€ 

â€œI noticed that,â€ came the low, worried response. â€œThe monoxideâ€™ll get him 
yet, if we donâ€™t hurry.â€ 

They were approaching cautiously now, almost sidling, to refrain from setting 
off the thoroughly irrational robot. Powell was too far off to tell, of course, but 
already even he could have sworn the crack-brained Speedy was setting himself 
for a spring. 

â€œLet her go,â€ he gasped. â€œCount three! Oneâ€”twoâ€”â€ 


Two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass 



jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs, gleaming like diamonds in the 
impossible sun. And in a pair of soundless puffs, they hit the ground behind 
Speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust. 

In the full heat of Mercuryâ€™s sun, Powell knew it was fizzing like soda water. 

Speedy turned to stare, then backed away from it slowlyâ€”and as slowly 
gathered speed. In fifteen seconds, he was leaping directly toward the two 
humans in an unsteady canter. 

Powell did not get Speedyâ€™s words just then, though he heard something that 
resembled, â€œLoverâ€™s professions when uttered in Hessians.â€ 

He turned away. â€œBack to the cliff, Mike. Heâ€™s out of the rut and heâ€™ll be 
taking orders now. Iâ€™m getting hot.â€ 

They jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts, 
and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly 
about them that Donovan looked back. â€œGreg!â€ 

Powell looked and almost shrieked. Speedy was moving slowly nowâ€”so 
slowlyâ€”and in the wrong direction. He was drifting; drifting back into his mt; 
and he was picking up speed. He looked dreadfully close, and dreadfully 
unreachable, in the binoculars. 

Donovan shouted wildly, â€œAfter him!â€ and thumped his robot into its pace, but 
Powell called him back. 

â€œYou wonâ€™t catch him, Mikeâ€”itâ€™s no use.â€ He fidgeted on his robotâ€™s 
shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence. â€œWhy the devil do I see these 
things five seconds after itâ€™s all over? Mike, weâ€™ve wasted hours.â€ 

â€œWe need more oxalic acid,â€ declared Donovan, stolidly. â€œThe concentration 
wasnâ€™t high enough.â€ 

â€œSeven tons of it wouldnâ€™t have been enoughâ€”and we havenâ€™t the hours to 
spare to get it, even if it were, with the monoxide chewing him away. Donâ€™t you 
see what it is, Mike?â€ 



And Donovan said flatly, â€œNo.â€ 

â€œWe were only establishing new equilibriums. When we create new monoxide 
and increase Rule 3 potential, he moves backward till heâ€™s in balance againâ€”and 
when the monoxide drifted away, he moved forward, and again there was 
balance.â€ 

Powellâ€™s voice sounded thoroughly wretched. â€œItâ€™s the same old runaround. We 
can push at Rule 2 and pull at Rule 3 and we canâ€™t get anywhereâ€”we can only 
change the position of balance. Weâ€™ve got to get outside both rules.â€ And then he 
pushed his robot closer to Donovanâ€™s so that they were sitting face to face, dim 
shadows in the darkness, and he whispered, â€œMike!â€ 

â€œIs it the finish?â€â€”dully. â€œI suppose we go back to the Station, wait for the 
banks to fold, shake hands, take cyanide, and go out like gentlemen.â€ He 
laughed shortly. 

â€œMike,â€ repeated Powell earnestly, â€œweâ€™ve got to get Speedy.â€ 

â€œI know.â€ 

â€œMike,â€ once more, and Powell hesitated before continuing. â€œThereâ€™s always 
Rule 1.1 thought of itâ€”earlierâ€”but itâ€™s desperate.â€ 

Donovan looked up and his voice livened. â€œWeâ€™re desperate.â€ 

â€œA11 right. According to Rule 1, a robot canâ€™t see a human come to harm 
because of his own inaction. Two and 3 canâ€™t stand against it. They canâ€™t, Mike.â€ 

â€œEven when the robot is half eraâ€” Well, heâ€™s drunk. You know he is.â€ 

â€œItâ€™s the chances you take.â€ 

â€œCut it. What are you going to do?â€ 

â€œIâ€™m going out there now and see what Rule 1 will do. If it wonâ€™t break the 
balance, then what the devilâ€”itâ€™s either now or three-four days from now.â€ 


â€œHold on, Greg. There are human rules of behavior, too. You donâ€™t go out there 



just like that. Figure out a lottery, and give me my chance.â€ 


â€œAll right. First to get the cube of fourteen goes.â€ And almost immediately, 
â€œTwenty-seven forty-four!â€ 

Donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by Powellâ€™s mount and then 
Powell was off into the sunlight. Donovan opened his mouth to shout, and then 
clicked it shut. Of course, the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in 
advance, and on purpose. Just like him. 


The sun was hotter than ever and Powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his 
back. Imagination, probably, or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even 
through the insosuit. 

Speedy was watching him, without a word of Gilbert and Sullivan gibberish as 
greeting. Thank God for that! But he darenâ€™t get too close. 

He was three hundred yards away when Speedy began backing, a step at a 
time, cautiouslyâ€”and Powell stopped. He jumped from his robotâ€™s shoulders 
and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged 
fragments. 

He proceeded on foot, the ground gritty and slippery to his steps, the low 
gravity causing him difficulty. The soles of his feet tickled with warmth. He cast 
one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliffâ€™s shadow and realized 
that he had come too far to returnâ€”either by himself or by the help of his 
antique robot. It was Speedy or nothing now, and the knowledge of that 
constricted his chest. 

Far enough! He stopped. 

â€œSpeedy,â€ he called. â€œSpeedy!â€ 

The sleek, modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps, 
then resumed them. 



Powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice, and found it didnâ€™t take 
much acting. â€œSpeedy, Iâ€™ve got to get back to the shadow or the sunâ€™ll get me. 
Itâ€™s life or death, Speedy. I need you.â€ 

Speedy took one step forward and stopped. He spoke, but at the sound Powell 
groaned, for it was, â€œWhen youâ€™re lying awake with a dismal headache and 
repose is tabooedâ€”â€ It trailed off there, and Powell took time out for some 
reason to murmur, â€œIolanthe.â€ 

It was roasting hot! He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, and 
whirled dizzily; then stared in utter astonishment, for the monstrous robot on 
which he had ridden was movingâ€”moving toward him, and without a rider. 

He was talking: â€œPardon, Master. I must not move without a Master upon me, 
but you are in danger.â€ 

Of course, Rule 1 potential above everything. But he didnâ€™t want that clumsy 
antique; he wanted Speedy. He walked away and motioned frantically: â€œI order 
you to stay away. I order you to stop!â€ 

It was quite useless. You could not beat Rule I potential. The robot said 
stupidly, â€œYou are in danger, Master.â€ 

Powell looked about him desperately. He couldnâ€™t see clearly. His brain was in 
a heated whirl; his breath scorched when he breathed, and the ground all about 
him was a shimmering haze. 

He called a last time, desperately: â€œSpeedy! Iâ€™m dying, damn you! Where are 
you? Speedy, I need you.â€ 

He was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant 
robot he didnâ€™t want, when he felt steel fingers on his arms, and a worried, 
apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears. 

â€œHoly smokes, boss, what are you doing here? And what am / doingâ€”Iâ€™m so 
confusedâ€”â€ 

â€œNever mind,â€ murmured Powell, weakly. â€œGet me to the shadow of the cliff 
â€”and hurry!â€ There was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a 



sensation of rapid motion and burning heat, and he passed out. 


He woke with Donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously. â€œHow are you, 
Greg?â€ 

â€œFine!â€ came the response. â€œWhereâ€™s Speedy?â€ 

â€œRight here. I sent him out to one of the other selenium poolsâ€”with orders to 
get that selenium at all cost this time. He got it back in forty-two minutes and 
three seconds. I timed him. He still hasnâ€™t finished apologizing for the runaround 
he gave us. Heâ€™s scared to come near you for fear of what youâ€™ll say.â€ 

â€œDrag him over,â€ ordered Powell. â€œIt wasnâ€™t his fault.â€ He held out a hand and 
gripped Speedyâ€™s metal paw. â€œItâ€™s O.K., Speedy.â€ Then, to Donovan, â€œYou know, 
Mike, I was just thinkingâ€”â€ 

â€œYes!â€ 

â€œWell,â€â€”he rubbed his faceâ€”the air was so delightfully cool, â€œyou know that 
when we get things set up here and Speedy put through his Field Tests, theyâ€™re 
going to send us to the Space Stations nextâ€”â€ 

â€œNo!â€ 

â€œYes! At least thatâ€™s what old lady Calvin told me just before we left, and I 
didnâ€™t say anything about it, because I was going to fight the whole idea.â€ 

â€œFight it?â€ cried Donovan. â€œButâ€”â€ 

â€œI know. Itâ€™s all right with me now. Two hundred seventy-three degrees 
Centigrade below zero. Wonâ€™t it be a pleasure?â€ 


â€œSpace Station,â€ said Donovan, â€œhere I come.â€
