the FIRST line of EVERY function is a call to LogStart

you pass all the values that were passed to the function to LogStart (and NOTHING else)

if the function DOES NOT return void then you use LogEndReturning directly BEFORE the return statement

if the function DOES return void you use LogEnd and pass it the same values you used for LogStart

when you compile there are no warnings

your output to the console matches that of the runable example

your output to the logfile matches that of the runable example

you actually logout of your account with logout or exit
